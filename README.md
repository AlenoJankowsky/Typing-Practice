# Typing-Practice

Typing Practice where the user has to type in words. If they type incorrect characters, they are still prompted to type in the correct character.
If they type in a correct character, they get to type in the next character of the current or next word.
 
While typing in correct or incorrect characters, there will be statistics computed in the back-end so they get to see how fast and how consistent they
typed words.
 
This is a general way to learn fast 10-finger typing and should be used as this.
